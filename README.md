# Life graph

Inspired by [this post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), I decided I wanted to make my own graph of my life.
In the comments on that post, there are many other graphs available, but most of them add lots of different things that I did
not care for. They looked extremely nice, but not nearly as simple as the box of squares originally showed in the post. The simplicity
of seeing my life on a tiny grid really hit me. I wanted to recreate that.

The folks at [waitbutwhy.com](https://waitbutwhy.com) own the idea behind this work. They also gave me permission to produce and realease
this code for free use by everyone else.

# Setup environment
`python3 -m venv .`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Run
Modify `make_graph.py` and then run `python3 make_graph.py`
